## MVP pages

### Core browsing

- `/tournaments` — All tournaments list (1930–present)
- `/tournaments/[year]` — Tournament detail: overview, group stage, knockout bracket, top scorers, squad list
- `/tournaments/[year]/matches/[matchId]` — Match detail: lineups, goals, cards, substitutions
- `/countries` — All nations list
- `/countries/[slug]` — Country detail: history, appearances, wins, players, matches
- `/players` — Players list with filter/search
- `/players/[slug]` — Player detail: biography, stats, tournaments, goals, cards

## First vertical slice (Checkpoint 5)

The first full end-to-end slice to validate the data pipeline and UI system:

| Entity | Page |
|---|---|
| Home | `/` |
| All tournaments | `/tournaments` |
| 1986 tournament | `/tournaments/1986` |
| 1986 final match | `/tournaments/1986/matches/[final-id]` |
| Brazil | `/countries/brazil` |
| Diego Maradona | `/players/diego-maradona` |

This slice was chosen because 1986 is data-rich (Maradona, "Hand of God", golden boot) and validates: tournament structure, knockout matches, player cross-referencing, and country pages.
